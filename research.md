    <h2>Project 1</h2>
    <p>
	My research focuses on applying genomic techniques to inform conservation policy and practice. I mainly work with ecosystem managers to identify and answer questions about population structure, genetic diversity, and inbreeding in plants that form the foundation of their restoration projects. I work with short reads, long reads, DNA, RNA, and methylation to give managers the best recommendations I can. 
    </p>
    <p>
	When not in the lab, I am easily distracted by butterflies and will often interrupt myself to point one out if I know the species.
